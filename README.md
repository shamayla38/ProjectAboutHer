# Overview
This project explores the musical attributes of two indie bands, Her and Her's, both of whom faced tragic fates. While the bands share similarities in name and tragic outcomes, our analysis investigates whether they are also similar in their musical characteristics. By using data from Spotify, we examine key musical attributes such as valence, tempo, energy, and key signature to highlight the distinct and overlapping patterns between the two bands. Our findings show that Her tends to have lower energy, tempo, and valence, reflecting a more melancholic or subdued emotional tone, possibly influenced by the illness of band member Simon Carpentier. In contrast, Her's, as a growing band, demonstrated a more energetic and diverse musical approach, with a broader range of keys used.

# File Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
data: Contains the data on musical attributes for both bands as obtained from Spotify API.
paper: Contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document, the reference bibliography file, and the final PDF of the paper.
scripts: Contains the R scripts used to download the data. This includes the script to interact with the Spotify API and generate musical attributes for both bands.
